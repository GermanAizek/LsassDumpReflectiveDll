### this project make a reflective DLL to use in post exploiting state to dump lsass memory without touch hard disk. 
this proejct Create a Reflective DLL Injector and a Reflective DLL for dump lsass memory without touch hard disk.

for test DLL by injector you can run :
#.\inject.x64.exe  <PID of Victim Process to inject> <Path to reflective dll: .\LsassDumpReflectiveDLL.dll>
  lsass.dmp file will save to c:/windows/temp folder.
